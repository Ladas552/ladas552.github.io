And mostly bobbing to <a href=https://osu.ppy.sh/>OSU!</a>, which let's you click circles to legally acquired song. And it supports Linux, kinda, most of the time, let me explain.<h2 id=Osu-Stable>Osu Stable</h2><hr><p>Is a classic Osu client that most people play on. It <strong>doesn't</strong> support Linux, but works quite well under <a href=https://www.winehq.org/>WINE</a>, and some community maintained scripts setup low latency and seamless desktop integration for adding maps and skins from <code>.osu</code> files.<p>I used this <a href=https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/1248084?n=1>install script</a> (check GitHub for more up to date instructions). Tested on KDE X11, XFCE X11 and BSPWM. Works fantastically and at the time of writing this post { <strong>2025-04-13</strong> } still maintained.<p>But can have audio <strong>lag</strong> because Wine compatibility takes some time, but make sure to enable <em>DXVK</em> and if on Nvidia, 32-bit Vulkan compatibility package. On something like Arch Linux it should be your go to OSU! setup.<h2 id=Osu-Lazer>Osu Lazer</h2><hr><p>But:<ul><li>Wine and arbitrary scripts have problems running on <strong>FSH'less</strong> OSes, hello <em>NixOS</em>,</ul><ul><li>Maybe you can't bear the <strong>audio lag</strong> from Wine(less than 1/4 of a second),</ul><ul><li>Annoyed about rare <strong>stuttering</strong> issues,</ul><ul><li>You want <strong>latest</strong> and greatest features,</ul><p>Then you might want to switch to <strong>Lazer</strong>. A leap in Osu clients that got native Linux support! As it is open source, you can build it yourself, but i do not recommend doing so, because networking is disabled for unofficial builds of the game. Which doesn't let you upload scores and chat.<p>Instead, download the <a href=https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases>official appimage</a>, and just play the game. You might need to update <strong>mesa</strong> package to play, also recommend <a href=https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher>AppImageLauncher</a> for smooth sailing if it's your first time using appimages.<p>Well, you would need to turn on Vulkan (experimental) rendering for better performance. Also don't use the Raw Input setting, it's broken on Linux.<h3 id=NixOS>NixOS</h3><hr><p>But if you don't want to run raw appimages, Osu Lazer is available on <code>nixpkgs</code> that auto updates for you, in particular, the <code>osu-lazer-bin</code>. But recently I had problems running it on Nvidia GPU (check <a href=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/372135>issue</a>)<p>Luckily, <a href=https://github.com/fufexan/nix-gaming/tree/master/pkgs/osu-lazer-bin>Fufexan's gaming flake</a> got working Osu that also fresher than the <code>nixpkgs</code> one. I use it.<p>Here's a simple flake structure for ya:<pre><code class=language-nix>{
  # you can scroll it
  description = "Osu Gaming";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    nix-gaming.url = "github:fufexan/nix-gaming";
  };
  outputs =
    {
    self,
    nixpkgs,
    ...
    }@inputs:
    {
      nixosConfigurations = {
        NixGamer = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
          specialArgs = { inherit inputs; };
          modules = [
            ./configuraton.nix
            {
              environment.systemPackages = [ inputs.nix-gaming.packages.${pkgs.system}.osu-lazer-bin ];
            }
          ];
        };
      };
    };
}

It's minimal, so doesn't ever lag, has a lot of mods for practice and fully local, so no multiplayer features either. Still open source tho.<p>You can import your Osu user from the site and go from there. Has some problems with Osu skins, but most should work fine.<h2 id=Software>Software</h2><hr><p>Well, at least now you can play the game, but to exceed in it you might want to configure hardware that you use. Like <strong>pipewire</strong> for less audio lag, <strong>tablet</strong> area and <strong>mouse</strong> dpi.<h3 id=Open-Tablet-Drivers-(OTG)>Open Tablet Drivers (OTG)</h3><hr><p>Just <a href=https://github.com/OpenTabletDriver/OpenTabletDriver>download it</a>, enable the daemon, reboot. If after connecting the tablet, it says that daemon connection is terminated, reopen the app.<p>Most tablets should work with it, but if not, check the git version, I used the one from <a href=https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/opentabletdriver-git>AUR</a>. If you use source based distribution, good luck building DotNet dependency.<p>The git and stable versions can have different configuration formats, so your Osu preset from git can be borked on stable. Just remake it using the GUI.<h3 id=Solaar>Solaar</h3><hr><p>It's a <a href=https://github.com/pwr-Solaar/Solaar>little application</a> to change your mouse settings, sensitivity and DPI included. Works perfectly with <strong>LogiTech</strong>.<p>Can work with keyboards too, but I never owned the compatible one.<h3 id=Pipewire>Pipewire</h3><hr><p>The default (<em>i hope</em>) audio system on your Linux distro. Check the guides on how to reduce audio latency, for <a href=https://gist.github.com/Kodehawa/edff6856470ad660a0d69416834b09da>example</a>. But here is a little snippet for NixOS users. Just be aware, your headphones can pop or crack, so experiment with this a little.<pre><code class=language-nix>environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.sbc ];
# Enable sound with pipewire.
services.pulseaudio.enable = false;
security.rtkit.enable = true;
services.pipewire = {
  enable = true;
  alsa.enable = true;
  alsa.support32Bit = true;
  pulse.enable = true;
  extraConfig.pipewire."92-low-latency" = {
    "context.properties" = {
      "default.clock.rate" = 48000;
      "default.clock.quantum" = 32;
      "default.clock.min-quantum" = 32;
      "default.clock.max-quantum" = 32;
    };
  };

I played <strong>OSU!</strong> for a couple of years now, and basically base my desktop preferences on it.<p>Like how my Windows 10 wouldn't run it well, so I switched to Arch Linux. Or how portals broke my X11 install of Osu Lazer, so I switched to Wayland on Niri. Well outside of that, buying my own drawing tablet on birthday and storing 50GB of osu maps, and silver switches on my osu keymaps.<p>Rhytm games are great, so I can't say I wasted any of that time and money on useless stuff, because tapping to the songs just gives another type of joy that can't be achieved otherwise.<p>Here is my <a href=https://osu.ppy.sh/users/22649018>Osu profile, if you are interested</a>. Trow in friend requests, can be mutuals lol.</div></div></main>
