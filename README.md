## Reminders

- smaller image sizes
used this command to resize: `convert -resize 720x720 -quality 100 image1.jpg image2.jpg`

- nerdfonts
modified nerdfontsOnlySymbols file with fontforge-gtk to only have like 4 symbols, and import it using css from nerdfonts github repo, it decreases the size user needs to download to see icons

## Todo

- add code block expansion
- better nav bar, add some flair to background color
- Table of Content can rended too long for the user to use on small width phone with a lot of headings. So need to fix that, but don't make the table scrollable. I hate that
- Pokemons aren't centered
- I want a [project oriented pages too](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages#using-a-custom-domain-across-multiple-repositories)
- better rss.xml theme, like [boltless](https://github.com/boltlessengineer/boltlessengineer.github.io/blob/989b409505d56f2c9fcbaf3cec1db8aac52156c7/templates/rss.xml#L2)
- make `/posts` directory better themed in `posts.html` template
